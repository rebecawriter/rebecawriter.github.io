This blog was written for a public sector organisation that helps disabled people lead more independent lives. They wanted more young people to apply for funding but were concerned that the application process was too confusing.

To make the process easier to understand, this blog uses a step-by-step guide which explains how to apply for funding. The colourful infographic features easily digestible answers to frequently asked questions, and the wider blog goes into more detail about what recipients can do with their funding.

Presenting key information in this way made the application process more accessible and less intimidating.
