Here’s a good example of how optimising blogs around the right search terms can help reach a new audience. This blog was written for a new homes builder in Fife, competing in a crowded market. The company was being pushed out of the top search engine results by brands with a high advertising budget.

Through detailed keyword research, I identified a number of popular local search terms that hadn’t been widely written about online. By drafitng helpful content around local interest-based search terms like, ‘Best dog walks in Fife’, I helped the company raise awareness of its new homes amongst potential new customers. They are steadily raising their profile online without having to spend thousands on advertising each month.
