# Rebeca
The repo for [rebeca.co.uk](https://www.rebeca.co.uk), made by [Evan Moss](https://GitHub.com/Evan-Moss). It is based on the [Junior](https://github.com/thundergolfer/junior-theme) theme by [Jonathon Belotti](https://github.com/thundergolfer). 

Rebeca is a freelance content writer in Edinburgh. This readme just shows the pages, and any interesting details in each of them. For a technical readme, go to the [Junior theme repo](https://github.com/thundergolfer/junior-theme) and check this repo for any changes to the theme.
