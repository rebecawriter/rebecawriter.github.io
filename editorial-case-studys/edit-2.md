This article was published in The Irish News, one of the most popular news outlets in Northern Ireland. It was written on behalf of a public sector organisation seeking to bring further financial support to disabled people in the country.

I worked closely with two advocates of the fund, interviewing them at length to capture their experience of living with a disability in Northern Ireland. I then contrasted their experiences to make a compelling case for extending funding to more recipients.
