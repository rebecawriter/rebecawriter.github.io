This Times Educational Supplement (TES) article was written for the leader of an independent school in Scotland. TES is a well-respected outlet and a go-to source of industry insight amongst school principals, teachers and education-leaders.

The article offers actionable steps that schools can take to enhance wellbeing amongst students. This lends credibility to the school and positions it as an industry-leader on the topic of student mental health, rather than a crowd-follower. In a competitive market, being able to demonstrate your expertise can be a huge business benefit.
